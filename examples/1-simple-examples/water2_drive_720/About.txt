This test calculation shows how it is possible to drive the rotation of a molecule beyond 180 degrees.
One water molecule is rotated along the z axis by 720 degrees in 10 degree increments while
the other molecule's orientation is held constant.
The xy coordinates of both water oxygens are held fixed so it is not possible for the molecules to move
perpendicular to the rotation axis.
