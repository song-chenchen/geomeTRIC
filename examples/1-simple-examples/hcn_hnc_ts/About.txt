This folder contains examples for running a transition state optimization.
The system is a prototypical HCN <-> HNC isomerization with HF/3-21G.

Because geomeTRIC places emphasis on maximizing job success rates,
the default values of the starting and maximum trust radius are set to
small values in the code (0.01 and 0.03 respectively).  This particular
test case can converge in fewer steps if larger values of the trust radii
are provided, but it is not guaranteed in general.
