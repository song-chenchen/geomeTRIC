Usage
=====

This section covers how to use geomeTRIC 
starting from the basics and the various features.

Quick Start
-----------

The easiest way to use geomeTRIC is the command line executable, ``geometric-optimize``.
Here we will show how to run an energy minimization on a water dimer with `Psi4 <http://www.psicode.org/>`_, a freely available QC program.

To get started, you need an input file
for your chosen quantum chemistry (QC) program or "engine" for computing energies and gradients (see :ref:`Engines <engines>`.)
This file will be parsed for the initial structures
and run parameters for the QC program.  
You also need the QC program to be installed into your environment
and in your path.

.. note:: The QC program's native geometry optimization methods will not be used, so setting the job type to optimization in the QC input file will have no effect.

For example, here is a `Psi4 <http://www.psicode.org/>`_ input file for a calculation on six water molecules (found in the ``examples/water2_psi4`` folder)::

    molecule {
    0 1
    O        0.8559100000   -1.3823600000    0.3174600000
    H        1.6752400000   -1.8477400000    0.4858000000
    H        1.1176100000   -0.4684300000    0.2057500000
    O       -1.0986300000   -0.8583700000    2.1731900000
    H       -0.4031000000   -1.1460800000    1.5818400000
    H       -1.0851100000    0.0968300000    2.1128200000
    }

    set basis sto-3g

    gradient('hf')

With this file saved as ``water2.psi4in``, an energy minimization is carried out using::

    geometric-optimize --engine psi4 water2.psi4in

When running, geomeTRIC will write output to the terminal, and also to ``water2.log``, showing progress of the optimization.
The calculation will finish when all of the convergence criteria are reached (individually met criteria shown in green):

The structures of each optimization step are written to ``water2_optim.xyz``, therefore when the job is completed, the optimized structure is the final structure in this file.
The folder ``water2.tmp`` is the working folder of the engine and contains the QC input and output files, as well as any temporary files for the most recent optimization step.

.. note::
    Psi4 has an `interface to geomeTRIC <http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/optking.html#interface-to-geometric>`_ 
    that allows the user to use geomeTRIC for geometry optimization by running Psi4 directly. 
    That is distinct from the usage described here.


Command line options
--------------------
You can get a full list of command line options by running ``geometric-optimize -h``.
